Overview:
The task is to determine whether an input object or array is empty. An empty object should not contain any key-value pairs, while an empty array should not have any elements. The input is assumed to be the output of JSON.parse.

Before we go any further, let us first clarify a few points that you will hear a lot about:

JSON:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data-interchange format that serves as a lightweight alternative to XML. It is widely used for transmitting and storing data in a structured format.
JSON consists of two main data structures: objects and arrays. The data is represented as a combination of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces {} for objects, and square brackets [] for arrays. The keys in an object must be strings, while the values can be any valid JSON data type, including objects and arrays.
Example of a JSON Object:

{
"name": "Pavitr Prabhakar",
"age": 17,
"city": "Mumbattan"
}
Example of a JSON Array:

[
"Peter",
"Gwen",
"Miles"
]
JSON.parse():
JSON.parse() is a built-in JavaScript function that converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object, arrayor a primitive value (such as a string, number, boolean, or null). It takes a valid JSON string as input and returns a corresponding JavaScript object, array or primitive value. This allows developers to work with JSON data in a native JavaScript format.

Example of using JSON.parse():

const jsonString = '{"name":"Pavitr Prabhakar","age"17,"city":"Mumbattan"}';
const parsedObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(parsedObject.name); // Output: Pavitr Prabhakar
console.log(parsedObject.age); // Output: 17
console.log(parsedObject.city); // Output: Mumbattan
Objects in JavaScript:
Objects are used to store collections of key-value pairs. The keys of an object can be any value that can be converted to a string, and the corresponding values can be of any data type, including objects and arrays.

Example of using Objects:

const person = {
name: "Pavitr Prabhakar",
age: 17,
city: "Mumbattan"
};
console.log(person.name); // Output: Pavitr Prabhakar
console.log(person.age); // Output: 17
console.log(person.city); // Output: Mumbattan
Now how to find length or size?
In JavaScript, the length or size property is used to determine the number of elements in an array or the number of key-value pairs in an object. For arrays, the length property returns the highest numeric index plus one. For objects, the length property is not available, so we need to use other methods like Object.keys() to get the number of key-value pairs.

Example of using length property:

const spiders = ["Peter", "Gwen", "Miles"];
console.log(spiders.length); // Output: 3

const person = {
name: "Pavitr Prabhakar",
age: 17,
city: "Mumbattan"
};
console.log(Object.keys(person).length); // Output: 3
Approaches:
The first way is to use JSON.stringify to convert the input array/object to a string. If the array or object is empty, it returns a string with opening and closing braces or curly braces.

The second approach is to use Object.keys() as suggested above to obtain the length and then verify if it is empty or not.

The third approach is to just use a for loop iterator to check whether there is something to iterate, and if there is, it implies the object is not empty, and if there is nothing to iterate, it implies the object is empty.

Approach 1: Using JSON.stringify
When you stringify an object using JSON.stringify(), the resulting JSON string will represent the object's key-value pairs as a string. In this context, the "length" property of the resulting string will represent the number of characters in the string, not the number of key-value pairs in the original object.

For example, consider the following object:

const person = {
name: "Pavitr Prabhakar",
age: 17,
city: "Mumbattan"
};
If you stringify this object using JSON.stringify(), it will produce the following JSON string:

{"name":"Pavitr Prabhakar","age":17,"city":"Mumbattan"}
The length of this JSON string will include the opening and closing curly braces, quotation marks, colons, and commas.

Thus in our case it should have a length of two i.e. for opening and closing braces/curly braces.

var isEmpty = function(obj) {
if (JSON.stringify(obj).length <= 2) return true
else return false
};

Complexity Analysis:
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of object

Space complexity: O(n), where n is the size of object

Approach 2: Using Object.keys
We can check the length of the keys using Object.keys() and if it's 0 then return true else false.

var isEmpty = function(obj) {
return Object.keys(obj).length === 0
};

Complexity Analysis:
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of object

Space complexity: O(n), where n is the size of object

Approach 3: Using loop
If the array/object is not empty, the interpreter will enter the for-in loop, and therefore the first return statement false will be run and if it is empty, the interpreter will not enter the for-in loop, and so the second return statement true will be executed.

var isEmpty = function(obj) {
for (const \_ in obj) return false;
return true;
};

Complexity Analysis:
The time and space is O(1) because we are just checking if we can enter the loop or not.

Time complexity: O(1)

Space complexity: O(1)

Interview Tips:
What is the difference between an empty object and an object with no properties?

An empty object refers to an object that does not have any key-value pairs. It means that the object does not contain any properties. On the other hand, an object with no properties still exists and may have properties in the future. It simply means that it currently does not have any properties defined.
How can you check if an object is empty in JavaScript without using the length of its keys?

To check if an object is empty without directly using the length of its keys, you can use a for...in loop. This loop iterates over the object's enumerable properties. If no properties are found during the iteration, you can conclude that the object is empty.
What is a Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO)?

A Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO) is a term used to describe a simple JavaScript object that is created using the object literal syntax or the Object() constructor. It refers to an object that does not have any specialized behavior or methods inherited from custom prototypes or built-in JavaScript classes. POJOs are often used as data transfer objects (DTOs) or as simple containers for storing and accessing data.
